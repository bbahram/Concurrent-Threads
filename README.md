# Concurrent Programming Using Threads

This project involves concurrent programming using Windows threads that solves the Minimum Distance Problem by dividing the problem into a number of subproblems, each of which is solved by a separate thread. The number of threads is equal to the number of cores available on the device this code is running on.<br>
This project functions similarly to the other project called "Concurrent Processes", which is accessible in my github profile as well, with the difference that this one uses threads instead of processes. There are no other source files to call here, but the source file calls itself and then handles the parent and child duties with shared memory.<br>
This project was written in 2019 and developed in C++, and it is one of my academic projects.
